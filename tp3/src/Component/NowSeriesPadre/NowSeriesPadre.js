                        cultivation and wakes up as Liao Tingyan, a disciple of the Qinggutian Sect. She's soon selected
                        to serve the reclusive Grandmaster Sima Jiao, a powerful cultivator who's been secretly sealed
                        inside a mountain for 500 years. Twisted by isolation and rage, he's cold, hot-tempered, and
                        bent on revenge. Liao Tingyan doesn't know that "her" original identity is a demonic assassin.
                        But to his surprise, she shows no ill will, no ambition, and no desire at all. Her nature
                        fascinates him. Thus begins an unlikely romance between a villainous immortal and a healing-type
                        "slacker," a connection that defies fate and spans lifetimes.</p>
